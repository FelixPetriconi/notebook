    "# The C++ Memory Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory consists of one or more contiguous sequence of bytes\n",
    "- Every byte has a unique address.\n",
    "    - Bytes are >= 8 bits\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Processor Memory Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "![Memory Hierarchy](img/memory-hierarchy.svg)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Threads and Data Races\n",
    "\n",
    "- All objects are accessible to all threads\n",
    "- When an evaluation of an expression write to a memory location\n",
    "    - and another evaluation reads or modifies the same memory location\n",
    "    - the expressions _conflict_ and there is a _data race_ unless\n",
    "        - both evaluations are on the same thread or same signal handler\n",
    "        - both are atomic operations\n",
    "        - one _happens-before_ another\n",
    "    - if a data race occurs the behavior of the program is undefined\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Memory Order\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory order specifies how regular, non-atomic memory accesses are to be ordered around an atomic operation\n",
    "- Absent any constraints, one thread can observe the values changed by another thread in any order\n",
    "- The default order for any standard library atomic operation is _sequentially-consistent_ (seq_cst)\n",
    "    - Don't use a different ordering unless\n",
    "        - You can demonstrate a performance gain\n",
    "        - You can _prove_ it is correct\n",
    "        - You have at least one other expert review your proof\n",
    "        - You write a complete description along with your proof and include it in the code\n",
    "        - You include a unit test to demonstrate the gain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Supported Memory Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relaxed: there is no synchronization or ordering constraints imposed on _other_ reads or writes, only the operation's atomicity is guaranteed\n",
    "- Consume: applies to a load operation\n",
    "    - no reads or writes dependent on the load operation may happen before the load\n",
    "    - for most processors, this only effects compiler optimizations\n",
    "- Acquire: applies to a load operation\n",
    "    - no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before the load\n",
    "- Release: applies to a store operation\n",
    "    - no reads or writes can be reordered after this store\n",
    "    - all writes are visible in other threads that acquire the same atomic\n",
    "    - all writes with a data dependency are visible in other threads that consume the same atomic\n",
    "- Acquire-Release: applies to read-modify-write operations\n",
    "    - Same guarantees as acquire and release for a single atomic operation\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Sequentially Consistent Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "- load operations are acquire\n",
    "- store operations are a release\n",
    "- read-modify-write are acquire and release\n",
    "- plus a single total order exists in which all threads observe all modifications in the same order\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intel hardware has a _strong_ memory model\n",
    "    - Every machine instruction has an implied acquire-release semantics\n",
    "    - That _does not_ imply that every operation is atomic\n",
    "    - And without specifying a memory order, the compiler is free to reorder operations\n",
    "    \n",
    "- ARM has a _weak_ memory model\n",
    "    - Every operation is a consume or release\n",
    "    - But without specifying a memory order, the compiler is free to reorder operations"
