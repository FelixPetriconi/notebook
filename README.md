## Mac installation instructions to run locally

- clone this repo and cd to the directory
- if you don't already have the xcode command line tools installed, install them
```
xcode-select --install
```
_Note:_ There is an issue with the Xcode 11 beta 5 command line tools which will cause the xeus-cling kernel to crash. A work around is to use xcode-select to select tools from an older version of Xcode. Download Xcode 10.3 from Apple's. Move to a folder such as`/Application/Xcode_10.3/`. And then select the developer tools from the package:
```
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_10.3/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
- install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
- install miniconda
```
brew cask install miniconda
```
- Create the conda environment
```
conda env create
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
conda init bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## To run the notebook
```
conda activate notebook
jupyter lab
```
- use control-c and `conda deactivate` to exit

## To setup complete environment with interactive slide editing and jekyl pages

- install utilities
```
brew install node
brew install fswatch
brew install rbenv
rbenv init
rbenv install 2.6.3
npm install -g browser-sync
gem install bundler
```

## To run complete environment
```
./tools/start.sh
```
- use control-c to exit

## To update environment
```
./tools/update.sh
```
## To prepare all slides before pushing to github
```
./tools/prepare.sh
```

## Windows installation instructions to run locally

The xeus-cling addition to Jupyter doesn't yet support Windows native. However, if you are running Windowns 10, you can run inside of the Windows Linux Subsystem.

- [Enable the Windows Linux Subsystem and install Ubuntu from the app store.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

- clone this repo and cd to the directory (can be done from Windows gui, window file system appears as `/mnt/c/...` inside Linux)
- Make sure your packages are up-to-date.
```
sudo apt update
```
- Install gcc
```
sudo apt install gcc
```
- install miniconda for Python 3.7
	- download the install script [here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
	- execute the downloaded script
	- when prompted `Do you wish the installer to prepend the Miniconda3 install location to PATH in your /Users/<name>/.bash_profile ? [yes|no]` answer yes

- create the conda environment
```
conda env create
```
- install utilities (REVISIT (sparent) : ruby may be redundant, implied by ruby-dev?)
```
sudo apt install npm
sudo apt install fswatch
sudo apt install ruby
sudo apt install ruby-dev
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
npm install -g browser-sync
sudo gem install bundler
```
Note: Need linux update script, must run `sudo bundle update` prior to `tools/start.sh`
